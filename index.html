        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophomore at Bob Jones University studying Biblical Studies, while working on my pilot licenses. I work for a tree company named Greenville Tree Co. .</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy playing sports, especially soccer. Over the summer I have the oppertunity usually to visit my family and help out at a Christian camp that my uncle is a director of. Usually I get to attend one or two camps then as well, sort of my parents way of rewarding me, if you will, for working and giving a lot of my time over to helping the camp in its starting years with my summers.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy running, I honestly just sort of got into running, I used to hate. I find running to be a great stress reliever and helps keep my heart and body fit.
            My goal is to one day fly commercially for a big airline and to use my unique ability to travel to help in missions across the world. Also i love languages and other cultures so I guess it all fits together nicely.
